# Q

We are encountering something very strange.
You may check with the repo tn1011, #157 and #158.
I checked many times on the settings of cross-section definition, connection node, manhole and pipe.

If we do connected manholes (#157) on manhole id 95000 and 95001, the model failed to be compiled. But if we do isolated manhole (#158), the model works (with no water flowing into the pipe)

I am wondering if you could help us check?
Thanks a lot!

Best Regards,Yung

# A
I looked at tn1011 #157 and conclude from this that:

1.
There is a v2_boundary condition at the western side of the model, but it is not working (it causes an error during the generation of the 3di model) <-- this is also the case in #164
You can fix it by shift it more to the left (the linestring must intersect the outer calculation cells; the linestring must intersect at least two calculation cells; the boundary linestring may be skewed by a maximum of 6 DEM pixels)

2.
the epsg_code is not filled in the v2_global_settings (must be the same as the dem raster epsg) <-- this is also the case in #164

3.
Isolated manholes do not exchange water with 2D, that is right.
The connected manholes (manhole id 95000 and 95001) cause an crash because the v2_connected_pnt and v2_calculation_point tables are filled and based on that the manholes are isolated.
I believe that the following happened in this sequence:
- the manholes id 95000 and 95001 were isolated
- the toolbox 'predict calc points' was used --> it fills the v2_connected_pnt and v2_calculation_point tables
- tried to simulated with the model
- the manholes id 95000 and 95001 were made conneted (but the v2_connected_pnt and v2_calculation_point tables were still filled)
- tried to simulated the model (resulting in a crash for sure)
How to fix? (not only this time, but this should always be done if you change calculation types or add/remove channels/pipes/nodes etc.)
either
- empty the v2_connected_pnt and v2_calculation_point tables and simulate the model
- or run the 'predict calc points' tool again, after you made the manhole connected
